Analysis of Order Trends, Cooking Preferences, and User Behaviour

Summary


Datasets pertaining to order trends, cooking preferences, and user behaviour are analysed in this study. 
The objective was to provide business recommendations, produce visualisations, and extract actionable insights.

Utilised Datasets The following datasets are used in the project:

UserDetails: Provides user demographics and account details. Logs of user interactions during cooking sessions are called cooking sessions.
OrderDetails: Details on user-placed orders. Goals Datasets should be cleaned and combined before analysis. Examine the connection between user orders and cooking sessions.
Determine which foods are popular and examine demographic variables. Put findings into visual form and offer business advice. Important Results


User Behaviour: Cooking sessions and order frequency are positively correlated. Weekends and evenings see the highest user activity.
Favourite Recipes Both cooking sessions and orders were greatly influenced by the top ten dishes. Preferences differed according on geography and age group.
Trends in Orders Weekends and holiday seasons saw the highest orders. Three to five things were in most orders.
The demographics In every dataset, users between the ages of 25 and 34 were the most active.
There was a lot of activity in [top cities/regions]. Visualisations The following visualisations are part of the project:
Heatmaps, line charts, and scatterplots for patterns over time. 
Popular dishes and demographic preferences are displayed using bar and pie charts. 
For conversion and retention rates, use funnel charts and cohort analysis. 
Business Suggestions Focus on High-Prospective Users: Use tailored offers to increase the number of sessions that turn into orders. 
Encourage Popular Dishes: Concentrate marketing efforts on the most popular dishes among the target audiences. 
Maximise Your Promotions: Plan your campaigns for holidays and busy times. Enhance Retention: Implement loyalty plans and initiatives to reactivate dormant users. 
Technologies and Tools Python: Analysing, combining, and cleansing data. Data processing and manipulation with Pandas and NumPy. Seaborn & Matplotlib: Creating visualisations. 
Jupyter Notebook: Analysing data interactively. GitHub: Project management and version control.
